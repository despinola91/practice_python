# Exercise:
# https://www.practicepython.org/exercise/2017/01/10/32-hangman.html

# This exercise is Part 3 of 3 of the Hangman exercise series. The other exercises are: Part 1 and Part 2.
# You can start your Python journey anywhere, but to finish this exercise you will have to have finished Parts 1 and 2 or use the solutions (Part 1 and Part 2).
# In this exercise, we will finish building Hangman. In the game of Hangman, the player only has 6 incorrect guesses (head, body, 2 legs, and 2 arms) before they lose 
# the game.

# In Part 1, we loaded a random word list and picked a word from it. In Part 2, we wrote the logic for guessing the letter and displaying that information to the user. 
# In this exercise, we have to put it all together and add logic for handling guesses.

# Copy your code from Parts 1 and 2 into a new file as a starting point. Now add the following features:
#     Only let the user guess 6 times, and tell the user how many guesses they have left.
#     Keep track of the letters the user guessed. If the user guesses a letter they already guessed, donâ€™t penalize them - let them guess again.

# Optional additions:
#     When the player wins or loses, let them start a new game.
#     Rather than telling the user "You have 4 incorrect guesses left", display some picture art for the Hangman. 
#     This is challenging - do the other parts of the exercise first!
